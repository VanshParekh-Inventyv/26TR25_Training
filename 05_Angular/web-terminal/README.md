# Angular Web Terminal

- This project is a web-based terminal emulator built using Angular 21. It simulates a real command-line interface in the browser, allowing users to execute predefined commands, view outputs, and interact with the terminal environment. The terminal supports command aliases, detailed explanations, and success feedback for each command, making it an excellent tool for learning, demonstrations, or simulating CLI workflows.
